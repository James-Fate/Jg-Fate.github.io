  <h1> Project 2 Simple html Page #1</h1>
 
  <p>   I am interested in seeing how detailed of a web page we will be able to create by the end of this semester. It would be very nice to learn and expand on these skills so that I could work on helping my family with thier businesses web page</p>
  
  <p>   HTML doesn't seem like it will be that complex once we work through it a few times</p>
